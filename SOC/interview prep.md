hi i am jr dioca, i am from cagayan de oro, philippines
ive been in cybersecurity for almost 3 years now with my experience mostly on offensive security, but i've been more interested with blue teaming recently.
i have spent almost 3 years on security research or what we call bug bounty hunting and was able to find legitimate vulnerablities on a lot of organizations from public bug bounty programs to private.
and also, ive been actively participating on high level CTF competitions both locally and global
some of the recent CTF competitions that i stand out was
i was hack4gov champion last year and my team went to the nationals finals
i was also the 1st runner up on the recent ASEAN Virtual CTF
and just days ago, i made it to the top 21 out of 780+ teams on Asia pacific region on  kaspersky CTF.
currently i've been diving into malware analysis and reverse engineering, DFIR, and Threat Hunting. I am also currently documenting my malware analysis reports on my personal blog which you could absolutely read and review.


refer to a playboook on investagating a specific category of alert
if not, i need to do the heavy lifing myself [SOC L1 Alert Triage](SOC-L1-Alert-Triage)

before escalating, i have to do the 5Ws (refer to [SOC L1 Alert Reporting](SOC-L1-Alert-Reporting) )

**Picking the Right Alert**
1. Filter the alerts - sort alerts by status
2. Sort by severity - sort alerts by severity
3. Sort by time - start with the oldest alerts and end with the latest ones.
