**tools**
1. PeStudio
2. . Detect it Easy

**tools for IR**
1. process hacker (FlareVM)
2. process monitor (FlareVM)
3. procDOT (FlareVM)
4. wireshark (REMnux)

<h2>analysis and IR</h2>
**before running malware**
process hacker (FlareVM) - observe  live activities
process monitor (FlareVM) - capture activity logs
wireshark (REMnux) - capture traffic 


**during running malware**
wait for 5 mins or more
