**CPU Architecture Overview**

![[Pasted image 20250712205243.png]]

**Overview:**
When a program has to be executed, it is loaded into the memory. 
From there, the Control Unit fetches one instruction at a time using the Instruction Pointer Register, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit executes it. 
The results are stored in either the Registers or the Memory.


**Registers Overview**

registers are divided into the following different types:
* [instruction pointer](#instruction-pointer)
- [General Purpose Registers](#General-Purpose-Registers)
- [Status Flag Registers](#Status-Flag-Registers)
- [Segment Registers](#sr)

# **Instruction-Pointer**
a register that contains the address of the next instruction to be executed by the CPU

32bit - EIP (Extended Intruction Pointer)
64bit - RIP (Register Intruction Pointer)

# **General-Purpose-Registers**
 are used during the general execution of instructions by the CPU.
 these registers are extended as 64-bit registers. **They contain the following registers**.
 * **EAX or RAX:** - Accumulator Register. Results of arithmetic operations are often stored in this register.
 * **EBX or RBX** - Base Register, often used to store the Base address for referencing an offset
 * **ECX or RCX** - Counter Register and is often used in counting operations such as loops, etc.
 * **EDX or RDX** -  Data Register, used in multiplication/division operations
 * **ESP or RSP** - Stack Pointer. It points to the top of the stack and is used in conjunction with the Stack Segment register. 
 * **EBP or RBP** -  Base Pointer. Used to access parameters passed by the stack. It is also used in conjunction with the Stack Segment register.
 * **ESI or RSI** - Source Index register. Used for string operations. It is used with the Data Segment (DS) register as an offset.
 * **EDI or RDI** - Destination Index register. It is also used for string operations. It is used with the Extra Segment (ES) register as an offset.
 * **R8-R15** - These 64-bit general-purpose registers are not present in 32-bit systems. They were introduced in the 64-bit systems.
