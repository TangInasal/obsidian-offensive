**Overview:**
When a program has to be executed, it is loaded into the memory. 
From there, the Control Unit fetches one instruction at a time using the Instruction Pointer Register, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit executes it. 
The results are stored in either the Registers or the Memory.


**Registers Overview**

registers are divided into the following different types:
* [instruction pointer](#instruction-pointer)
- [General Purpose Registers](#gpr)
- [Status Flag Registers](#sfr)
- [Segment Registers](#sr)

**Instruction Pointer**
a register that contains the address of the next instruction to be executed by theÂ CPU

32bit - EIP (Extended Intruction Pointer)
64bit - RIP (Register Intruction Pointer)

**General-Purpose Registers**
