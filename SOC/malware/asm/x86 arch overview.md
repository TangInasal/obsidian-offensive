**Overview:**
When a program has to be executed, it is loaded into the memory. 
From there, the Control Unit fetches one instruction at a time using the Instruction Pointer Register, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit executes it. 
The results are stored in either the Registers or the Memory.


**Registers Overview**

registers are divided into the following different types:
	- [instruction pointer](#instruction-pointer)
- General Purpose Registers
- Status Flag Registers
- Segment Registers
