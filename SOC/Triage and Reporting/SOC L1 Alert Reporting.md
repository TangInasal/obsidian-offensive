## Report Format

 Five Ws  approach and include at least these items in the report:

- **Who**: Which user logs in, runs the command, or downloads the file
- **What**: What exact action or event sequence was performed
- **When**: When exactly did the suspicious activity start and ended
- **Where**: Which device, IP, or website was involved in the alert
- **Why**: The most important W, the reasoning for your final verdict


## Escalation Guide
You should escalate the alerts if:
1. The alert is an indicator of a major cyberattack requiring deeper investigation or DFIR
2. Remediation actions like malware removal, host isolation, or password reset are required
3. Communication with customers, partners, management, or law enforcement agencies is required
4. You just do not fully understand the alert and need some help from more senior analysts

## Escalation Steps

To escalate the alert, in most cases, all you have to do is to **reassign the alert to the L2 on shift** and ping them in corporate chat or in person. In some teams though, you may be required to create a formal written escalation request with dozens of required fields.

No matter what the agreements are, L2 will eventually receive the ticket from you, read your report, and contact you in case of any questions. Once everything is clear, the L2 analyst will typically research the alert details further, validate if the alert is indeed a True Positive, communicate with other departments if needed, and, for major incidents, start a formal Incident Response process.
