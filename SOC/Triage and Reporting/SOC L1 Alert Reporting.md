## Report Format

 Five Ws  approach and include at least these items in the report:

- **Who**: Which user logs in, runs the command, or downloads the file
- **What**: What exact action or event sequence was performed
- **When**: When exactly did the suspicious activity start and ended
- **Where**: Which device, IP, or website was involved in the alert
- **Why**: The most important W, the reasoning for your final verdict
