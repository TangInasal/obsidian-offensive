There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:
- DNS root server
- Authoritative name server
- Non-authoritative name server
- Caching server
- Forwarding server
- Resolver

|**Server Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DNS Root Server`|The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe.|
|`Authoritative Nameserver`|Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. Based on the country, company, etc., authoritative nameservers provide answers to recursive DNS nameservers, assisting in finding the specific web server(s).|
|`Non-authoritative Nameserver`|Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.|
|`Caching DNS Server`|Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.|
|`Forwarding Server`|Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.|
|`Resolver`|Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.|

DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply `DNS over TLS` (`DoT`) or `DNS over HTTPS` (`DoH`) here. In addition, the network protocol `DNSCrypt` also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.
