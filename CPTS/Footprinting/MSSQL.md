[SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (`SSMS`) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately. 
Keep in mind that since SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system an admin or developer is planning to manage the database from. 
This means we could come across a vulnerable system with SSMS with saved credentials that allow us to connect to the database.

Many other clients can be used to access a database running on MSSQL.

#### MSSQL Databases
| Default System Database | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `master`                | Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance                                                                                                                                               |
| `model`                 | Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. Any setting changed in the model database will be reflected in any new database created after changes to the model database |
| `msdb`                  | The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts                                                                                                                                      |
| `tempdb`                | Stores temporary objects                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `resource`              | Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server                                                                                                                                  |

## Default Configuration
When an admin initially installs and configures MSSQL to be network accessible, the SQL service will likely run as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`. 
Connecting from the client-side is possible through Windows Authentication, and by default, encryption is not enforced when attempting to connect.

## Dangerous Settings
This is not an extensive list because there are countless ways MSSQL databases can be configured by admins based on the needs of their respective organizations. We may benefit from looking into the following:
- MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
- The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed certificates
- The use of [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/configuration-manager/named-pipes-properties?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Weak & default `sa` credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account
---
## Footprinting the Service
NMAP has default mssql scripts that can be used to target the default tcp port `1433` that MSSQL listens on.

We can see the `hostname`, `database instance name`, `software version of MSSQL` and `named pipes are enabled`. We will benefit from adding these discoveries to our notes.
