**FTP is a `clear-text` protocol that can sometimes be sniffed if conditions on the network are right. However, there is also the possibility that a server offers `anonymous FTP`.**
[FTP commands list](https://www.smartfile.com/blog/the-ultimate-ftp-commands-list/)
#### TFTP
`Trivial File Transfer Protocol` (`TFTP`)
`does not` provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP
TFTP uses `UDP`, making it an unreliable protocol

**Commands of `TFTP`:**

| **Commands** | **Description**                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect`    | Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.                                                                     |
| `get`        | Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.                                                               |
| `put`        | Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.                                                             |
| `quit`       | Exits tftp.                                                                                                                            |
| `status`     | Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on. |
| `verbose`    | Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.                                             |
Unlike the FTP client, `TFTP` does not have directory listing functionality.

#### Default Configuration
One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions is [vsFTPd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html). 
The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found in `/etc/vsftpd.conf`,
#### vsFTPd Config File
```shell-session
cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"
```

In addition, there is a file called `/etc/ftpusers` that we also need to pay attention to, 
this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service.
