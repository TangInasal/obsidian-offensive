Avoid history to save commands

```
# Prevent writing to the history file at all
unset HISTFILE

# Don't save this session's command history in memory
export HISTSIZE=0
```

If commands are accidentally added to the command history, 
individual command entries can be removed with `history -d`:
```
# Removes the most recently logged command.
# Note that we actually have to delete two history entries at once,
# otherwise the `history -d` command itself will be logged as well.
history -d -2 && history -d -1
```

The entire command history can be purged as well, 
this approach is very **likely to be noticed**:
```
# Clears the in-memory history and writes the empty history to disk.
history -c && history -w
```

**For a more destructive approach** 
You can either delete the contents of the `.bash_history` file 
or link it to `/dev/null` to prevent  history logging.
```
# Permanently disable bash history by linking it to /dev/null
ln /dev/null -/.bash_history -sf

# Clear the existing bash history
echo "" > .bash history
```
