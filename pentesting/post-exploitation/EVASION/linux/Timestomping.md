alteration of modification/access timestamp of file/directory
```
# Changes the access (-a) and modification (-m) times using YYYYMMDDhhmm format.
touch -a -m -t 202210312359 "example"

# Changes time using a Unix epoch timestamp.
touch -a -m -d @1667275140 "example"

# Copies timestamp from one file to another.
touch -a -m -r "other_file" "example"

# Get the file's modification timestamp, modify the file, then restore the timestamp.
MODIFIED_TS=$(stat --format="%Y" "example")
echo "backdoor" >> "example"
touch -a -m -d @$MODIFIED_TS "example"
```

`touch`Â can only modify the access and modification timestamps. 
It can't be used to update a file's "change" or "birth" timestamps.


If you have root pric, you can work around this limitation 
by modifying the system clock, 
creating or modifying a file, then reverting the system clock:
```
ORIG_TIME=$(date)
date -s "2022-10-31 23:59:59"
touch -a -m "example"
date -s "${ORIG_TIME}"
```

**NOTE:** 
creating a file also updates the parent directory's modification timestamp as well!
