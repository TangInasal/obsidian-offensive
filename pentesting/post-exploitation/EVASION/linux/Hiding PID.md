**Hiding PID from Non-root users**

By default, the `/proc`  filesystem exposes process information to all users. 
You can limit this access to only root by modifying the `/proc` mount options.

```
sudo mount -o remount,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hidepid=2 /proc
```
- `hidepid=2`: Hides all processes that don't belong to the user.
- `hidepid=1`: Hides only process details but still shows PIDs.
