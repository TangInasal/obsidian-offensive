- Avoid calling commands such asÂ `whoami`
    - List your kerberos tickets
    - Look for the owner of the process that spawned your beacon
    - List your environment variables: ``dir env:`` and ``dir env:USERNAME
    - Use a beacon object file (BOF) to bring your own whoami
- DCSync (Replication) is always done between domain controllers
    - DCSync from machine accounts look more legit than with a user account
    - You don't need to dump the whole database, the account krbtgt will grant you every access you need.
- Kerberoasting must use the correct encryption, RC4 is often the default in offensive tool instead of AES.
