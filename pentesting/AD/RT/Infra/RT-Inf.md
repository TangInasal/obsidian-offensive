2. Payload server -dedicated server for **hosting malicious scripts** (accessible by both attacker and victim)
3. Redirector Server - a system **proxies** all your traffic **to your C2** server

TAS **setup multiple** redirectors to act as **pivot points** back to your C2
**Protects** the original **location of** the **C2**
Prevents client from seeing the actual **C2**
