**enumerate users:**
`aws iam list-users`

**enumerate user policies:**
**Inline** - assigned directly in the user (or group/role) profile and will be deleted if the identity is deleted. Can be considered as hard-coded policies.

**Attached** - a.k.a managed policies, can be reusable. An attached policy requires only one change in the policy, and every identity that policy is attached to will inherit that change automatically.

enumerate INLINE policy:
``aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <USERNAME>``

enumerate ATTACHED policy:
`aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <USERNAME>`

enumerate user's GROUP:
`aws iam list-groups-for-user --user-name <USERNAME>`

enumerate USER POLICY permissions:
`aws iam get-user-policy --policy-name <POLICYNAME> --user-name <USERNAME>`
